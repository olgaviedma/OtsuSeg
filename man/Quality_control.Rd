\title{Quantitative Comparison of Binary Raster with Reference Shape}
\usage{
Quality_control(binary_shape, reference_shape, metrics = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{binary_shape}{A shapefile representing the binary raster (e.g., burn scars).}

\item{reference_shape}{A shapefile representing the reference vector shape (e.g., actual burn scars).}

\item{metrics}{A vector of metric names to calculate. If NULL, all available metrics are computed.
Available metrics are: "Precision", "Recall", "F1_Score", "IoU", "OS", "US", "E",
"SimSize", "Loc", and "AFI". Default is NULL, which computes all metrics.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the computed metrics and their values.
}
\description{
This function calculates various metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score)
to compare a binary raster (in shapefile format) with a reference vector shape.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  binary_shape <- st_read("binary_shape.shp")  # Your binary raster shapefile
  reference_shape <- st_read("reference_shape.shp")  # Your reference shapefile
  result <- Quality_control(binary_shape, reference_shape)
  print(result)
}
}
