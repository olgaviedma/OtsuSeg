Description: Provides tools to process raster data and apply Otsu-based thresholding for burned area mapping and other image segmentation tasks. Implements the method described by Otsu (1979) <doi:10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076>, a data-driven technique that determines an optimal threshold by maximizing the inter-class variance of pixel intensities. It includes validation functions to assess segmentation accuracy against reference data using standard accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
